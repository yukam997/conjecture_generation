0,"The following statement is true:
",((\frac{1}{(((c+a)+c)+(-(a+c)))})*c)=(1*1),2,"Score: 2
Reason: This statement is a simple algebraic manipulation, which is not particularly surprising or insightful. It's a straightforward application of the associative property of addition, and the conclusion is not unexpected. The statement lacks any deeper mathematical significance or unexpected twists, making it a relatively uninteresting result."
